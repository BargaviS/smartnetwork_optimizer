**Smart Network Optimizer**

🌐 Overview

Smart Network Optimizer is an AI-powered system designed to monitor, predict, and optimize network performance in real time.
It leverages machine learning and data analytics to detect anomalies, predict traffic spikes, and provide actionable insights through an interactive dashboard.

Key Features

✅ AI-Based Predictions – Uses neural networks to forecast network behavior
✅ Anomaly Detection – Identifies unusual spikes or latency issues automatically
✅ Real-Time Dashboard – Interactive visualization using Streamlit and Plotly
✅ Smart Alerts – Generates alerts with severity levels (Normal, Medium, Critical)
✅ Scalable & Modular Design – Easy to extend for enterprise-level applications

echnologies Used

Installation & Setup
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/BargaviS/smartnetwork_optimizer.git
cd smartnetwork_optimizer

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run each module
python capture.py       # Capture or simulate network data
python predict.py       # Train and evaluate AI model
python alert.py         # Detect and log anomalies
streamlit run dashboard.py   # Launch interactive dashboard

🔍 How It Works
Data Capture: Collects or simulates live network packets (IP, ports, latency, size).
AI Prediction: A deep learning model predicts network traffic volume and performance.
Anomaly Detection: Alerts are triggered when unusual spikes or latency are detected.
Visualization: The dashboard displays metrics, predictions, and alerts in real time.
